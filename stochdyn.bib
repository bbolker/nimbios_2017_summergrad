	abstract = {Stochastic chemical kinetics describes the time evolution of a well-stirred chemically reacting system in a way that takes into account the fact that molecules come in whole numbers and exhibit some degree of randomness in their dynamical behavior. Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm {(SSA)} and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale {SSA.}},

	abstract = {The figure showing how the model of Kermack and {McKendrick} fits the data from the 1906 plague epidemic in Bombay is the most reproduced figure in books discussing mathematical epidemiology. In this paper we show that the assumption of constant parameters in the model leads to quite unrealistic numerical values for these parameters. Moreover the reports published at the time show that plague epidemics in Bombay occurred in fact with a remarkable seasonal pattern every year since 1897 and at least until 1911. So the 1906 epidemic is clearly not a good example of epidemic stopping because the number of susceptible humans has decreased under a threshold, as suggested by Kermack and {McKendrick}, but an example of epidemic driven by seasonality. We present a seasonal model for the plague in Bombay and compute the type reproduction numbers associated with rats and fleas, thereby extending to periodic models the notion introduced by Roberts and Heesterbeek.},

  journal = {Ecology},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {87},
  pages = {1478-1488},
  abstract = {Applying the recent developments of scale transition theory, we demonstrate
	a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up local scale interactions
	to regional scale dynamics with field data. Dynamics on larger spatial
	scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because
	of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at
	the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental
	factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to
	scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model
	for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition
	theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial
	variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third,
	measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities
	at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine
	nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition.
	Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a
	freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce
	the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at
	the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the
	importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},
