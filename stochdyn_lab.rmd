## Simulation

It's always a good idea to practice estimation techniques on simulated data before trying them on real data.

- If you can't get the right answer when you know what it is, in clean data where you know exactly what's going on, you're doomed.
- Allows you to:
     - explore what kind of precision you should be able to get in a real situation with a given amount/noisiness of data (formally, this is *power analysis*; e.g. see chapter 5 of @Bolker2008)
	 - diagnose whether your problems will be solved by more data or are more fundamental (e.g. *identifiability problems*)
     - quantify properties of your estimation technique (bias, mean squared error, coverage)
     -  evaluate the robustness of your estimation method by trying it with simulated data that do *not* exactly match the theoretical model underlying the estimator

A reasonable first stochastic model for an epidemic:

$$
\begin{split}
\text{incidence (new infectious)}: \phi(t) & \sim \text{Binom}(N=S(t),p=1-\exp(-\beta I(t)/N \cdot \Delta t)) \\
\text{recovery (old infectious lost)}: \psi(t) & \sim \text{Binom}(N=I(t),p=1-\exp(-\gamma \cdot \Delta t))\\
\end{split}
$$

- the $1-\exp(-h \Delta t)$ transformation turns a rate (specifically a *hazard*: $P(\textrm{event occurs in } \{t,t+dt\}|\textrm{event hasn't happened yet})/dt$) $h$ into a probability: this means we can use rates $>1$ in a discrete-time model without things going crazy
- the $\Delta t$ isn't really necessary - we will set $\Delta t=1$ below - but it is sometimes more convenient to have it in the equations than to rescale $\gamma$ and $\beta$ to explore the dynamical consequences of discrete time.
- similarly, scaling infection as $I/N$ is unnecessary in a constant-population model (we could just rescale $\beta$) but it makes $\beta$ a little easier to interpret

**Stop: think about this model; explain it to yourself or to your neighbor.**

- Remembering that the mean of a binomial random variable is $N \cdot p$, what are the expected infectious and recovery periods? What is the distribution of the infectious period?
- Remembering that $\exp(x) \approx 1+x$ when $x \ll 1$, what is the expected infection rate when  $I \Delta t$ is small?
- $R_0$ can be defined as the expected number of secondary infections caused by a primary case, over the entire infectious period, in a completely susceptible population - can you compute it for this model?  What are the conditions required for an epidemic to succeed (on average)?

An R implementation of the $t \to t+1$ mapping function.

- this uses the "magic" function `with()` [so we can use the names associated with the parameter and state vectors as labels] and returns the results as a list containing a vector [to make `deSolve` happy].
- this version has only process error.

```{r dynsim1}
SIRdsim1 <- function(t,y,params) {
   g <- with(as.list(c(y,params)), {
       prob.inf <- 1-exp(-beta*I/N)
       prob.rec <- 1-exp(-gamma)
       newinf <- rbinom(1,size=S,prob=prob.inf) ## pick one binomial deviate
       recover <- rbinom(1,size=I,prob=prob.rec)
       c(S=S-newinf,
         I=I+newinf-recover,
         R=R+recover,
         incidence=newinf,
         recover=recover)
   })
   list(g) ## for deSolve()
}
```
The incidence and recovery aren't state variables, they're auxiliary observations, but this is a convenient way to include them in the output.

You can run this with `deSolve::ode()`, using the `"iteration"` method (`ode()` is mostly intended for solving differential equations):
```{r runsim1}
set.seed(101)   ## set state of random number generator
m1 <- ode(t=1:20,
          ## starting values and parameters must be *named vectors*
          y=c(S=99,I=1,R=0,incidence=0,recovery=0),
          parms=c(beta=2.0,gamma=1.0,N=100),
          func=SIRdsim1,
          method="iteration")
```

If you prefer (or if you are using MATLAB), you can write a version with a `for` loop instead.

For convenience, write a plotting function for the results:
```{r plotfun}
plotfun <- function(x) {
    Y <- x[,-1] ## all state variables (omit time)
    matplot(x[,"time"],Y,type="l",lty=1,
            xlab="time",ylab="number")
    legend("topright",
           colnames(Y),
           lty=1,
           col=1:ncol(Y))
}
```

**Stop: run this model (pick a set of sensible parameters, e.g. that make $R_0=4$ and $r=\beta -\gamma$ not too large) and examine the output.**

- Convince yourself that you understand the model by adjusting the parameters to make the epidemic die out (i.e. $R_0<1$).
- If you use R: use `head()`, `tail()`, `plot()`, and `plotfun()` from above to examine the output.

*Note that `plot(ode)` messes with your graphics settings.  To restore the settings to a full-page plot, either (1) use `par(mfrow=c(1,1))` or (2) use `dev.off()` (or click a button) close your graphics window (the next plot you create will open a new window with fresh settings).*

### Model variants

$$
%\tiny #2 doesn't work??
\newcommand{\tsub}[2]{#1_{{\textrm{#2}}}}
\newcommand{\phiobs}{\tsub{\phi}{obs}}
\newcommand{\psiobs}{\tsub{\psi}{obs}}
\newcommand{\pobs}{\tsub{p}{obs}}
\begin{split}
\text{observed incidence}: \phiobs(t) & \sim \text{Binom}(N=\phi(t),p=\pobs) \\
\text{observed recovery}: \psiobs(t) & \sim \text{Binom}(N=\psi(t),p=\pobs)
\end{split}
$$

- Add observation error to incidence and recovery by making the observed value a binomial deviate (in R, `rbinom(1,size,prob)`). (Out of laziness, I'm assuming the reporting probabilities are the same for incidence and recovery.) Call the function `SIRdsim_obsproc`.
- Make a deterministic version of the function. (This is useful for comparing with the stochastic variant, and for optimizing.) Call this function `SIRdsim_determ`.

## Trajectory matching (shooting)

Now we'll implement a trajectory-matching solution to estimate
the parameters of the model.

```{r lab_solns}
source("lab_solns.R")
```

- Fit to incidence, i.e. try to match the model-predicted $\phi$ to the observed $\phiobs$)
    - write a function `determfun(parms,nobs=20,N=100)` that takes a named parameter vector `[beta gamma]` and returns just the vector of incidences
    - Assume that the observed $\phi$ value is a Poisson random variable with mean equal to the value returned by `determfun()` (use the R function `dpois()`).
	- assume that you know the population size $N$ (100 in this case) and that the epidemic starts with one infected individual, zero recovereds, and $N-1$ susceptible individuals (in general, models with unknown population size *and* unknown transmission rates have severe identifiability problems).
    - remember you need to specify `start` as a list (containing `beta` and `gamma`) and `data` as a list (containing an incidence vector)
	- use `method="Nelder-Mead"`

```{r tfit}
incid <- m1_obsproc[,"incidence"]
tfit <- mle2(minuslogl=incidence~dpois(determfun(c(beta=beta,gamma=gamma))),
             data=list(incidence=m1_obsproc[,"incidence"]),
             ## trace=TRUE,
             start=list(beta=4,gamma=1),
             method="Nelder-Mead")
```

```{r liksurf,echo=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
objfun <- function(parms) {
    exp.inc <- determfun(setNames(parms,c("beta","gamma")))
    return(-sum(dpois(incid,exp.inc,log=TRUE)))
}
library(emdbook)
cc <- curve3d(objfun(c(beta=x,gamma=10^y)),
              sys3d="none",
              xlim=c(1.1,2.2),
              ylim=c(log10(0.1),log10(50)))
```

<blockquote class="spoiler">
**Problem**: crazy estimates (true values were $\beta=2$, $\gamma=1$)?
```{r surf,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(viridis)
par(las=1)
with(cc,image(x,y,log(z-min(z)+0.0001),col=viridis_pal()(40),
              xlab="beta",ylab="log10(gamma)"))
points(2,0,pch=16,cex=2)
```
But $R_0$ (= $(1-exp(-\beta I_0/N)) N/(1-exp(-\gamma))$) isn't *that* far off:
```{r R0}
R0fun <- function(beta,gamma,N=100,I0=1) {
    return((1-exp(-beta*I0/N))*N/(1-exp(-gamma)))
}
```
True value `r round(R0fun(2,1),1)` vs. estimated `r round(R0fun(coef(tfit)[1],coef(tfit)[2]),1)` ...

</blockquote>

## Gradient matching (one-step-ahead)

For the simpler forms of gradient matching you
need to be observe the *full state of the system without error*
(but see @Ellner+2002)
- for a model with a scalar state like the logistic, this is not
crazy (we just have to assume proc error $\ll$ obs error).
- this would also work for the [Reed-Frost model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Frost_model), where infectious individuals are assumed to recover after one time step.
- for our example, we need to assume we can observe both incidence ($S \to I$) and recovery ($I \to R$) transitions.

If we know the initial states (e.g. assume $I(0)=1$, $S(0)=N-1$, $R(0)=0$), and all of the incidence ($\phi$) and recovery ($\psi) values, we can recover the complete sequence of $S$ and $I$ (and hence compute all likelihoods) via $S=N-\textrm{cumsum}(\phi)$, $I=\textrm{cumsum}(\phi)-\textrm{cumsum}(\psi)$. Then we can compute the probabilities of infection and recovery, and then compute binomial negative log-likelihoods.

```{r stepahead}
stepahead <- function(beta,gamma,incidence,recover,N=100) {
    ## hacks to make sure sum(recovery) == sum(incidence),
    ##  recovery(t) <= I(t)
    recover <- round(sum(incidence)/sum(recover)*recover)
    excess <- sum(recover)-sum(incidence)
    if (excess>0) {
        recover[which.max(recover)] <- recover[which.max(recover)]-excess
    }
    S <- N-cumsum(incidence)
    I <- pmax(0,cumsum(incidence)-cumsum(recover))
    p.incid <- 1-exp(-beta*I[-length(I)]/N)
    p.recov <- 1-exp(-gamma)
    ## [-1], [-length(S)] used to match S, I
    ## at *previous* step with incidence and recovery
    ## in *current* step
    nlik.incid <- dbinom(incidence[-1],size=S[-length(S)],
                         prob=p.incid[-length(S)],log=TRUE)
    nlik.recov <- dbinom(recover[-1],size=I[-length(I)],
                         prob=p.recov[-length(S)],log=TRUE)
    return(-sum(nlik.incid)-sum(nlik.recov))
}
```

```{r gfit,results="hide"}
## check:
stepahead(beta=4,gamma=1,
          incidence=m1_obsproc[,"incidence"],
          recover=m1_obsproc[,"recover"])
gfit <- mle2(minuslogl=stepahead,
             data=list(incidence=m1_obsproc[,"incidence"],
                      recover=m1_obsproc[,"recover"]),
             start=list(beta=4,gamma=1),
             method="BFGS")
```

Still biased, but closer:

```{r}
coef(gfit)
confint(gfit,method="quad")
```

## State-space models in JAGS


```{r jags_file,echo=FALSE}
cat(scan(file="sir.jags",what="character",sep="\n"),sep="\n")
```

Make three *identical* lists containing starting values for
$\beta$, $\gamma$, and incidence:

```{r inits}
incid <- m1_obsproc[,"incidence"]
incid <- incid[incid>0]
inits <- replicate(3,list(newinf=incid,
                          beta=4,gamma=1),
                   simplify=FALSE)
```

```{r fit_jags_model,cache=TRUE}
fn <- "data/jags_model_fit.rds"
if (!file.exists(fn)) {
    j1 <- jags(model.file="sir.jags",
               data=list(incid=incid,
                         N=100,
                         nobs=length(incid)),
               inits=inits,
               parameters.to.save=c("beta","gamma","p.report"),
               progress.bar="none")
    saveRDS(j1,fn)
} else {
    j1 <- readRDS(fn)
}
library(coda)
library(lattice)
xyplot(as.mcmc(j1))
densityplot(as.mcmc(j1),layout=c(2,2))
summary(as.mcmc(j1))
```

### Real data!

K. Dietz gives some data on a pneumonic plague outbreak in Harbin (China) in 1910/1911; the data are extracted (I think) from \cite{international_plague_conference_1911_:_mukden_report_1912}, in \cite{dietz_epidemics:_2009}.
```{r get_harbin,echo=FALSE}
(harbin <- read.csv("data/Dietz_harbin_sm.csv"))
par(las=1,bty="l")
plot(plague_deaths~week,data=harbin)
```
Dietz says he used a mean infectious period of 11 days and found an initial population size of 2985 and an $R_0$ value of 2.  Fitting $\beta$ and $N$ as parameters, using $R_0=\beta N/\gamma$, and taking $\gamma=1/11$, see if you agree (assume 100% mortality, and that death occurs at the end of the infectious period).

```{r jags_harbin,cache=TRUE}
harbin_inits <- replicate(3,list(
                                newinf=round(harbin[,"plague_deaths"]),
                                beta=6e-5,gamma=1/11),
                                  simplify=FALSE)
j2_t <- system.time(j2 <- jags(model.file="sir.jags",
           data=list(incid=round(harbin[,"plague_deaths"]),N=3000,
                     nobs=nrow(harbin)),
           inits=harbin_inits,
           n.iter=10000,DIC=FALSE,
     parameters.to.save=c("beta","gamma","p.report"),
     progress.bar="none"))
```
(This takes about 2 minutes on my laptop)


```{r}
xyplot(as.mcmc(j2))
```

We can convert
```{r}
pairs(as.matrix(as.mcmc(j2)),pch=".",gap=0,
      col=rep(c("black","blue","red"),each=1000))
```
